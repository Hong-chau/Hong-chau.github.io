### CPSC 120

* Lab 4, Part 2

I like lab 4, part 2 because I get to learn about the if-statements. I really enjoy this lab because I did not feel lost and was able to complete the assignments. This lab motivated me to put more effort into the lab.

* Lab 7, Part 1

I like this lab because I felt accomplished after completing the lab. My partner and I had a lot of errors to fix after writing the code. Even though fixing the errors was frustrating, I enjoy the mini celebration we had whenever we managed to reduce the number of errors.

* Lab 5, part 2

I like lab 5, part 2 because I learn how a simple spelling mistake can fail the code. I have always hear of these warning in coding, but have not experience the frustration until this lab. This made me realizes that patiences is a skill that would be helpful in this field.
